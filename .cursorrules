# ========== Scratchpad for Planning & Memory ==========

[scratchpad]
# Use this to plan upcoming features, break down tasks, and mark progress.

# Example:
# [ ] Build voice-powered job search for blue-collar users
# [ ] Add Hindi/Bengali TTS fallback for low literacy
# [ ] Integrate feedback into Matching AI scoring model

[lessons]
# Add anything Cursor should not forget
# - 2025-05-28: Do not block edits to package.json — needed for dependency management
# - Use tsconfig paths correctly when referencing shared packages
# - Avoid making changes across unrelated packages unless required
# - Ask if unsure between two interfaces or types
