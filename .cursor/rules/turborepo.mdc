- **Initializing Turborepo in an Existing Directory**
    - To initialize Turborepo in a directory that is already structured like a monorepo (e.g., contains `apps/` and `packages/` folders), use the simplest form of the creation command.

- **Correct Command:**
    - The command should be run in the project root. It will interactively prompt for a package manager.
    ```bash
    npx create-turbo@latest .
    ```

- **Common Pitfalls (Learnings):**
    - Do not use flags like `-y`, `--use-npm`, or `--no-git` with `create-turbo`. The modern script is designed to be fully interactive. It will ask for the project name, package manager, and whether to initialize a git repository during the setup process. Incorrect flags will cause the command to fail.
