## 🧠 **AI Development Philosophy**

Our development approach follows a **"Core Features First, AI Second, Business Intelligence Throughout"** strategy:

1. **Build Core Features** with comprehensive data collection hooks across all three tiers
2. **Deploy with Analytics** to capture real user behavior from white-collar, grey-collar, and blue-collar users
3. **Collect Training Data** from actual platform usage and hierarchical interactions
4. **Train AI Models** on authentic user interaction patterns across the employment hierarchy
5. **Deploy Smarter Features** that continuously improve business performance and user experience

This ensures our AI learns from real-world usage patterns of India's employment ecosystem rather than theoretical assumptions.
